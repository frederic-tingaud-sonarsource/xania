The Drawbridge
   |R <Warning, you are entering a high level area!>|w~
       An enormous wooden drawbridge is all that stands between you and the
chilly water below.  To the north of you, you can see the great portcullis
that guards the entrance to the fabled city of Camelot.  To the south, you
can still see the lands of Xania through the hazy fog, but to the east an
impenetrable wall of fog blots out the view.  You can hear water lapping
on a shore somewhere, possibly below you...

The Gatehouse~
        The portcullis hangs above you. Its three inch diameter spikes,
look very menacing.  The guards who stand here seem unperturbed by your
presence, and continue their gossip almost immediately after your rude
interuption.  The drawbridge stretches out to the south and there is a
large courtyard to the north.

The Southern Courtyard~
        The hustle and bustle of every day life in a large city is epitomised
here in Camelot.  People mill around you, all going about their business in
their own little worlds - almost like a hive.  That's where the similarity
with a hive ends - the courtyard is bedecked in linens and beautiful flowers,
such as you have never seen.  The people, though poor, all seem quite content.
The great Castle of Camelot looms above you to the north.

The South Wing~
        This part of the Castle is open to all, and it is obvious the king
wants everyone to believe in the legendary wealth of Camelot.  The walls
are hung with gilt edged battle flags, many of them depicting the great
attles that King Arthur and his men have won.  The floor is carpeted in
thick fresh hay, giving of a very sweet aroma, the occasional heavy footmarks
hardly leave a mark on it.

a large bookshelf has been erected.  The books upon it are all accounts of
the battles faught and won by King Arthur and his brave knights.  From the
decor of the room, it is easy to surmise that this used to be the war room
of the king, but since he brought peace to his lands it has been no longer
needed.  The floor has been marked by the passing of many iron shod men.

is a clear space where the jester entertains people with his juggling tricks
and deranged sense of humour.

barge rowing along it but leaving no trace.  Inside the barge a small but
beautiful lady stands, parting the mist that surrounds them like a curtain.

here, as if the walls themselves had shrunk back in terror.  Twisted lines
criss cross the corridor to create the impression that the walls of Camelot
have veins like aliving animal.  The secret door to the west is obviously
there to protect people rather than prevent people from seeing this dark
gruesome sight...

lady hangs above you with a small moon painted upon her brow.  In contrast,
there are more battle scenes, but the walls are becoming bare now and you
can hear the laughter of male voices in the distance to the east.

At the Corner of the East Wing~
        The bare walls seem to be closing in on you.  A wave of nausea hits
you and you can't help feeling claustrophobic in this environment.  A glint
of light can be seen through a small aperture cut into the wall in the angle
of the corner.  To the west, the South Wing extends into the distance and to
the north, the East Wing disappears out of view.

Taking a closer look at the paintings, you discover that they are of Arthur's
fore-fathers.  Uther Pendragon stares down at you relentlessly and you begin
to get uncomfortable under his unwaverring gaze.

        Some huge iron doors stand to the south blocking your view of what
lies within.  You can hear the sounds of male laughter and the occasional
clank of armour.  From the sounds of it, there is a body of fighting men

Inside the War Room~
        This enormous room houses the legendary Round Table.  The most
renowned of Arthur's knights are invited to become Knight's of the Round
Table, an elite fighting force.  These men are highly trained and dedicated
killers, but fiercely loyal to their king.  The room is decorated in the
colours of each knight, depicting his family heritage, and battles he has
fought and won.  The bright colours of the knights dazzle you, and the sea
of faces becomes a blur.

Inside a small chapel~
        This elegant chapel is small to the standards of Xania, where there
are numerous Gods to worship.  The people who frequent this chapel dedicate
their lives to the "One" God.  The altar is a structure made almost totally
of gold, with an enormous wooden crucifix adorning the front.  There are
rows of benches either side of a main, silk carpeted walkway leading
directly to the altar.  A picture of their "Christ" hangs above the altar,
staring down at you from the heavens.  There is a small door in the south
wall.

crucifix fixed to the top, in front of which is a small kneeling cushion.
The King spends a lot of his time here, contemplating his life, loves and
victories.  Your intrusion has broken his concentration!

with a similarly green covered felt.  There is a clothes chest at the foot
of the bed, and a large crucifix stands atop it.
