|WWOW|w you can see |rnothing|w. 
The reason for this is that the nonbeliver who once owned this was 
very worried about theft of |rhis|w possessions. 
If no one could find anything on him no one could charge him with theft. 
So he came up with a cunning plan, and this invisible holder is the result.

Grassy dell~
You are in a small dell. There is lush green grass beneath your feet.
The purity of the air makes you feel vibrant and young. 
It occurs to you that this place seems too good, too perfect.
No mortal gardener no matter how talented could produce such a healthy place.
As you watch, a bush to the north starts to sway. 
It's movement increases until it is a blur. It busts into bright |Rred flames|w
The flames burn stronger until they are bright |WWhite|w. 
The flames rise and take human form it beckons you to come north.
