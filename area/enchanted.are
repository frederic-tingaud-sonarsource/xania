A large, beautiful dragon rests here, picking dinner from between its claws.
~
A large, beautiful dragon peers up at you from cleaning its claws. As you
draw closer, it stands fully erect, wings spread wide.  It comes forth, out of
light shadows, and the fires from the nearby cavern sparkle off its deep
maroon scales.  Flashes of its few scattered golden scales reflect off the
flames as well, almost blinding you.

Here in the midst of the forest lies this smallish pond.  A small clearing

life.  Slick with thick sludge, the 'water' doesn't move...no frogs hop on
lillypads, no deer come to sip at her edge, and no trees grow around her.
Survival of the fittest comes to mind as you now realize WHY there are no

Young ones frolick and trample over one another without even a second

stay there with their kind.  Even if one happened to venture this way, they
would be dealt with by the law keepers on this side...and then from their
own dark side for desertion...

meet.  The sludge from the dark side thins out, making way for cleaner
waters to the east and south.  Even the air above the water smells and
feels cleaner, no longer leaving that horrid thick stench that stuck in your
lungs on the western side.  Although you don't see any birds yet, the sky
ahead is filled with the sweet melodies of happy flighers.

Life!!  The water on this side is pure and clean enough to drink, bathe and
cool off.  Fish jump into the air from below the surface.  Birds singing
above dive into the clear cool water for a dip.  Parents from the woods bring
their offspring to the shore east of here to enjoy sunshine by the water.

Between the forest and the pond, here is where many come to bathe and

Starting to get a little cleaner, the beginnings of life can be detected here
in the pond.  Not life that has sprouted here, just that of those who have
ventured to see the difference between the two sides of the pond.  The
water is not clean enough yet to produce life.

The pond starts to get a little cleaner about here.  Although still no life
starts off here, at least it is clean enough for animals to visit briefly.
Dragonflies buzz about, though never landing; a frog from the eastern side
tries the safety of a decaying log, but jumps off quickly as it falls apart
under his legs.

Animals visiting the clearing swim about, trying to push each other
underwater in a playful way.  The younger ones stay closer to the shore,
just learning to swim by watching their siblings and being encouraged by
their parents.  Frogs hop on lillypads, then get bumped off and thrown into
the water by turtles who sneakily swim under the plant and tip them with
their heads.

happily, and birds above sing the most sweetest songs they know.

A pathway leads towards some plains in the east.

and dragonflies swoop down (careful to avoid the frogs' tongues) to snatch
up water striders that swim the water's surface.  It's very beautiful here.

Grass grows thick here -- you need to walk very carefully so as not to trip
over roots.  The animals who frequent the woods run and scamper as
though the roots aren't even there.  The sun shines down on you from
between the boughs of the trees (but don't look up, cuz a birdie might poop
on your face).

This massive cavern is so old, by the looks of it, that you're not sure if it
was a natural occurance or creature-made.  A couple of stalagtites hang
here and there from the heavenly high ceiling.  The mighty walls are
covered with a moss-type growth that stretches to the ceiling.  As you turn
looking around the cavern, you notice an indentation, what appears to be a
small tunnel.
