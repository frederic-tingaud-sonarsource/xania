|bStairway to the Lair of the Shadow Council 
[Shadow Council of Mephistopheles Clan]|w~
You make your way down a long dark stairway, quickly approaching the secret
Temple of the Shadow Council. You see a dim light below you. The tunnel
walls around you are a foul, earthy black colour and an evil stench
emanates from the oily liquid which clings to them. Up above, the
shielded stairway opens out into dark enclosed space, somewhere in
the city of Midgaard.

Entrance to the Lair of the Shadow Council~
You have arrived at the secret underground lair of the Shadow Council.
The lighting here is dim but adequate, consisting of only a few glowing
runes carved into the walls. Under the watchful eye of Mephistopheles, you
feel safe in this evil sanctuary. From here, a long hallway stretches east,
into other rooms of the Secret Lair. A tall statue stands in the corner of
the room.

The Dark Hallway~
This is a pretty ordinary looking room in the Council's Lair.
Looking around, you can see a plaque mailed to the wall, and another statue
in the corner. You can hear the scuffling of feet in the darkness, and you
also notice a shadowy door to the north. You can continue east, or go back 
west.

The Barracks of the Shadow Council~
When you step into this room, you immediately notice the cozy beds and the
bright fire roaring in the fireplace. You feel very warm and comfortable
just standing here. This is where members of the Shadow Council rest, to
regain strength, and meditate, to regain magickal power. Light from the fire
flares off of a statue in the corner.

This is the room where members of the Shadow Council can practice the dark
magicks and skills to defeat their enemies. A tall elf is here assisting in

drug, which you assume the Council members consume in order to enhance 
their performance.
