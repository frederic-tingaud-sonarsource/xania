Broadside~
You are floating alongside the hull of a great sailing ship. Below the
waterline the curves of its lower hull are crusted with barnacles and algae,
while the timbers above have been bleached by the searing sun.  There are
several portholes, presumably for some kind of weaponry. Affixed
to its prow is a great slab of oak with the letters V A L K Y R I E carved
into it. A number of ropes hang loose as if to invite you aboard.

You're standing at the base of the foremast. Its surface is pitted and
uneven, having been punished over many years by the cruel weather. Above,
its boom carries several great sails that drive the ship forwards. A line of
iron pegs have been hammered into the side of it. To the south you see a
small vessel tied to the deck, and the forecastle rises to the north.

vessel appears to have been heavily used o carry crew and heavy cargo.
Its cracked rudder has been stained by years of heavy use. You see
large masts rising up to the north and south.

horizonally. It bears four iron handles with which to turn it so that ropes
can be hauled in and out more easily. The crew seem to be busy with their
duties.

A massive loading hatch leads to the deck below.

This section of the main deck features a large deck-mounted harpoon. The
curves of its iron chassis have been bolted firmly into the deck. A curve of
steel several feet wide provides a mounting point for the two ends of a
harpoon rope made of thick sinew. The tip of the launcher protrudes over the
ship's rail, ready to strike at any target of sufficient size.

Crew's Quarters~
This is the eastern side of the crew's quarters where several bunk beds and
coffers offer a home away from home to the crew. In the darkness you can hear
the sound of scurrying rats the creaking timbers of the hull. The quarters
continue west and a store room is to the east.

You find yourself in a well organised, tidy room within the ship's aft. A
fine mahogany desk sits at its centre, complete with a large map and various 
navigational instruments. A portrait of a rather noble looking man hangs on
the west wall over a sealed porthole. A black ceramic stove stands in the
corner, the embers within pumping out a pleasant wave of warmth. In the
corner, a short but well kept mattress lies close to the deck. A door leads
north to the officer's area, and a much sturdier steel door blocks the way
south.

up, carrying smoke and heat out into the fresh air. Several giant copper
pots are steaming and bubbling with a frothy, fishy brew. There's a pair
of shelves carrying some spices, loaves of bread and a bowl of lemons. Over

From: The Council of Uk`tet
To:   The Mayor of Midgaard
Date: The 4th of Autumnskin, year of the Egdad.
Sir,

With immediate effect, the Imperial State of Uk`tet issues this notice sealing the
fate of all of the leaders of Vricillia. All members of the Vricillian council are
to be hunted down and put to death immediately, whether they reside within the 
so called Enclave of Vricillia (not recognised by the Empire), or whether they have
fled into exile.  We ask that you pursue these heretics and bring them to justice.

Yours faithfully,

    Overkin M`bagne, Private Secretary to his Imperial Majesty.
